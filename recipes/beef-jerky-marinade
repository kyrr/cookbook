#Beef Jerky Marinade

## About

I made a beef marinade, to make fried beef for a salad. Rey liked it as beef jerky flavouring, so i'm noting it down to try.



## Ingredients

* Beef Top Rump, sliced into 8mm thick pieces, 1-1.5 inch strips

* 1.5 inch Frozen Ginger, finely grated

* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce

* 3 tablespoons Soy Sauce

* Season with Salt and Pepper


## Step 1: The Preparation


1. Prepare the beef, and add all of the ingredients to the beef. Leave for a few hours.

2. Add more Soy Sauce as you cook, if making jerky then baste the meat.
