#Beef Brisket Chilli

## About

I made a beef brisket chilli con carne to take with us on a camping trip, a nice warming pre-prepared meal.

I adapted Jamie Oliver's recipe, my version contains smokey ingredients that Jamie's does not. This recipe will feed 4-6 people.

## Ingredients

* 500 g Beef Brisket, trimmed and sliced into 2.5cm thick pieces across the grain
* 4 thick rashers of Smoked Bacon, fat trimmed off, chopped into 2cm pieces
* 125 ml hot Coffee
* 1 large dried Chillies (ancho, chipotle or poblano)
* 1 heaped teaspoons Ground Cumin
* 2 heaped teaspoons Smoked Paprika
* 1 heaped teaspoon Dried Oregano
* 2 fresh Bay Leaves
* 1 large Red Onions, peeled and diced
* 1 fresh Chillies
* 2 Cinnamon Bark pieces
* 3 large Cloves of Garlic, peeled and finely sliced
* 1 x 400 g tins of Chopped Tomatoes
* 1 tablespoons Brown Sugar
* 1 x 400 g tin of Kidney Beans
* 1 tablespoons Brown Sugar
* 200ml Red Wine
* Olive Oil
* Sea Salt
* Freshly Ground Black Pepper
* Freshly Ground White Pepper

## Step 1: The Preparation

1. Prepare the beef brisket. Cut the piece of brisket into 1 inch slices and cube it into 1 inch cubes, this makes it easy to remove any fat.
2. Prepare the bacon. Remove most of the fat, chop into 2cm pieces.
3. Prepare a fresh coffee, put your dried whole chillie(s) into it and leave it to soak.

## Step 2: Making The Chilli 

1. Put your casserole pan (I used a Le Creuset), add some oil to the pan and put it on a low heat.
2. Add your red onion, cumin, paprika, oregano and bay leaves.
3. Once the onions have started to brown, add the bacon.
4. Fry for 5-10 minutes until the bacon is mostly cooked.
5. Deseed all of the chillies and finely dice them, add them to the mixture with the cinnamon bark pieces.
6. Crush and finely dice the garlic and add it to the pot with salt, pepper, the chilli-infused coffee, tinned tomatoes, brown sugar, red wine and brisket. Cover with a lid and simmer for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
7. After three hours, take it off the heat. Use two forks to pull apart the brisket pieces so that the meat is shredded and well mixed into the sauce, drain your kidney beans and add them to the mixture.
8. Put it back on a low heat for 30 minutes with the lid on to cook the beans.

I’ll hand you back to Jamie for serving advice:

Have a taste and season well – if you require a bit more heat (like I would), this is the time to deseed and chop the rest of your fresh chilli and stir it in. Dollop a big spoonful of soured cream over the chilli if you fancy it, and serve straight from the pan, with fluffy rice, flatbreads or potatoes and a really nice fresh lemony green salad. Don't forget multiple cold beers! Enjoy.
