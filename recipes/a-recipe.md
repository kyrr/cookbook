# My Minestrone Soup

## About

Last weekend, Reyhan and I were particularly hungover and in the mood for soup. 
This is my take on Minestrone. 

This recipe will make a large saucepan of soup, enough for four large bowls.

## Ingredients

* Bacon Lardons (200g)
* Onion (1 medium red or white, coarsely chopped)
* Spring Onions (4 sliced)
* Garlic (2 cloves, crushed)
* Pancetta (110g pre-sliced, chopped into 1" pieces)
* Carrots (2 thinly sliced, diagonally)
* Chopped Tomatoes (1 tin)
* Yellow Split Peas (100g)
* Rey's Homemade Chicken Stock (600ml)
* Knorr Vegetable Stock (600ml)
* Ham Hock (200g, pulled)
* Spaghetti (100g, broken into 1.5" pieces)
* Olive Oil
* Salt & Pepper
* Tabasco *optional

## Step 1: The Preparation

1. Put some olive oil in a large saucepan, add the bacon lardons and fry them on a medium heat.
2. I then add the onions. Once the onions have started to brown pop in the garlic and pancetta.
3. Boil the kettle.
4. Put the split peas in a small saucepan, with some boiled water from the kettle. You want to put them on a fairly high heat to achieve a rolling boil.

## Step 2: Making The Soup

1. It is now time to add the carrots, all the stock and the tin of tomatoes to the large saucepan.
2. Season with salt and pepper to taste. You may also like to add Tabasco, or you might like to add this after serving.
2. Drain the split peas, add them to the large suacepan. At this point the split peas will not be thoroughly cooked, they will finish off whilst the soup gently boils.
3. Leave the soup to boil for 15 minutes (check it after 10 minutes too). 
4. Once the peas are pretty much cooked you can add the ham hock and spaghetti. It is important not to add the ham hock too soon as it is precooked and it will become rather tough.
5. Once the pasta is cooked the soup is ready to serve.


Notes

* The ingredients were all bought from Tesco, each pack dictated the quantity of meat used. You can adjust this accordingly.
* Given the choice I would have used Waitrose Ham Hock over Tesco, as recommended by @bon.
* I used spaghetti but you could use any small / thin pasta.
* A serving suggestion - slices of olive ciabatta, warmed in the oven.
